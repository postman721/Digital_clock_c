The executable can be run as follows:

cd into the folder that has it and:
./clocktime

Alternatively, place it anywhere you want and create a symbolic link to /usr/bin.

Example:

sudo ln -s /home/user/Digital_clock3/Release/executable/clocktime /usr/bin/clocktime

Now the command clocktime should open the clock.
